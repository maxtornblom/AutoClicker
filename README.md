# Auto Clicker Usage Guide

This project consists of an auto clicker that can be controlled using keyboard shortcuts and a GUI for changing settings dynamically.

## Features

- Start/stop clicking with the `Caps Lock` key.
- Quit the program using the `Q` key.
- Change the click delay and button (left/right) using a GUI.

## Important Note

Make sure that the **auto-clicker executable** (`.exe` file) and the **`settings.json` file** are placed in the **same folder**. The program will automatically load and update settings from the `settings.json` file. If the file is missing, default values will be used, but your settings will not be saved unless the file is present.
